    "\n",
    "1. **Response Length and Detail:**\n",
    "   - **gemini-2.5-pro**: Produces the most comprehensive and well-structured responses with detailed explanations, often including examples and structured sections (e.g., \"The Core Process\", \"Foundational Concepts\").\n",
    "   - **gemini-2.5-flash**: Provides detailed responses with good organization, similar to Pro but potentially slightly less comprehensive.\n",
    "   - **gemini-2.5-flash-lite**: Generates concise responses that cover the main points but may be less detailed than the Pro version.\n",
    "   - **gemini-2.0-flash**: Produces structured responses but may have different formatting or depth compared to 2.5 versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Token Usage:**\n",
    "   - More powerful models (like Pro) tend to generate longer, more detailed responses, resulting in higher output token counts.\n",
    "   - Flash-lite models are optimized for efficiency, often producing shorter responses with fewer tokens.\n",
    "   - Input tokens remain consistent across models since the prompt is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Response Quality and Structure:**\n",
    "   - **Pro models** excel at creating well-organized, hierarchical responses with clear sections and subsections.\n",
    "   - **Flash models** balance speed and quality, providing good responses but potentially with less elaborate structure.\n",
    "   - **Flash-lite models** prioritize speed and efficiency, delivering concise but still informative answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Content Depth:**\n",
    "   - Higher-tier models (Pro) tend to provide more nuanced explanations, include more examples, and offer deeper insights.\n",
    "   - Lower-tier models (Flash-lite) focus on covering the main points efficiently without extensive elaboration.\n"

    "**Discussion: Impact of System Prompt Changes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Response Style and Tone:**\n",
    "   - **Default prompt** (\"You are a helpful assistant\"): Produces balanced, general-purpose responses with a friendly, accessible tone.\n",
    "   - **Academic prompt** (Expert professor): Generates more formal, structured responses with deeper explanations, potentially using more technical terminology and academic language.\n",
    "   - **Concise prompt** (Brief technical writer): Produces shorter, more direct responses with bullet points or lists, prioritizing brevity over detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Response Length:**\n",
    "   - Academic prompts tend to generate longer responses as they encourage detailed explanations.\n",
    "   - Concise prompts significantly reduce output length, focusing on essential information only.\n",
    "   - Default prompts produce moderate-length responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Content Organization:**\n",
    "   - Academic prompts often result in better-structured responses with clear sections, headings, and hierarchical organization.\n",
    "   - Concise prompts favor flat structures like bullet lists.\n",
    "   - Default prompts provide moderate organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Implications:**\n",
    "   - **For educational content**: Use academic/system prompts to get detailed, well-structured explanations.\n",
    "   - **For quick reference**: Use concise prompts to get brief, to-the-point answers.\n",
    "   - **For general use**: Default prompts work well for balanced responses.\n",
    "   - System prompts act as a \"persona\" that guides the model's behavior, making it crucial to choose the right prompt for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Token Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - Different system prompts can significantly affect token usage (especially output tokens).\n",
    "   - Concise prompts are more cost-effective for applications with token limits.\n",
    "   - Academic prompts may be worth the extra tokens if detailed explanations are needed.\n"

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n",

      "\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development. The techniques used to train LLMs, such as deep learning and neural networks, are core machine learning concepts. Therefore, LLMs are a specific, advanced type of machine learning model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Interdependence \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t In essence, machine learning is the field of study and the set of techniques. LLMs are a powerful manifestation of these techniques. Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nA filmed record of stage magic doesn’t make a lot of sense, if you think about it. An \\nillusionist needs a live audience to conjure deep feelings of mystery and wonder, \\nbecause it’s all happening in the room right in front of you, and you can study the \\nperformers and the stage to try to figure out how they did the tricks—and be delightfully \\nmystified when you can’t. In movies (and on TV), the magic tricks themselves can’t \\nactually impress you, because editing and visual effects can do just about anything. \\nThat means that the only magic trick left is staying a step ahead of the plot guessers in \\nthe audience, whose primary source of pleasure is figuring out where things are going \\nbefore the movie gets there. To its credit, the “Now You See Me” trilogy, about magic \\nexperts tricking powerful bad guys, understands this principle and conveys it with \\nhumor and a light touch. That understanding, plus a strong cast, is the only thing \\npreventing the films from turning into jumbled, giant bags of arbitrary plot twists, eager \\nto outsmart viewers into nonsense. \\nThe third entry in the series, “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” stays on the right side of \\nthat risk as it reintroduces the Four Horsemen, a quartet of conjurers and other \\ntricksters, and throws them into a plot to steal the world’s biggest diamond. Jesse \\nEisenberg‘s J. Daniel Atlas, the erstwhile leader of the group, is even more confidently \\nforceful now (Eisenberg has aged out of wunderkind arrogance, his onscreen \\nsuperpower in films like “The Social Network” and Zack Snyder’s DC films, and into \\nsomething more grounded). As in the other movies, a lot of the fun comes from \\nwatching his equally egotistical team resist his authority, bicker, and insult each other. \\nIt’s all overseen by new-to-the-series director Ruben Fleischer (reunited with his \\n“Zombieland” stars) and four credited writers. The team tries to balance giving \\naudiences something old and something new, while simultaneously laying the track for \\nthe series to continue with younger characters if the returning players get tired or ask for \\ntoo much money to appear in a fourth installment. \\nThe aforementioned huge diamond is the property of glamorous international crime \\nsyndicate boss Veronika Vanderberg (Rosamund Pike), a South African. In this one, the \\never-morphing quartet is rounded out by Woody Harrelson‘s porkpie-hatted mentalist \\nMerritt McKinney; Dave Franco‘s card shark Dave Wilder; and Isla Fisher (who replaced \\nLizzy Caplan in the second movie as the group’s sole female member) as Henley \\nReeves, an escapologist who used to be Danny’s assistant and girlfriend. Morgan \\nFreeman makes a brief return appearance as Thaddeus Bradley, the retired ex-magician \\nturned debunker, and once the Grandmaster of The Eye, the secret society that has \\n(some) authority over the Horsemen. And there are some other surprise appearances \\nthat we won’t divulge here, even though they’re listed on IMDb. \\nThe opening sequence seems like an anniversary celebration of the Horsemen’s \\nfounding, but it turns into a debut for a trio whose illusions serve charity and social \\nactivism: Justice Smith’s Charlie, Ariana Greenblatt’s June, and Dominic Sessa’s Bosco\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\nLeroy. After the trio outs a crypto huckster and redistributes his wealth, Danny is so \\nimpressed that he recruits them to join the Horsemen in a mission to Antwerp, where \\nVeronika is cultivating her network of diamond aficionados to maintain her real \\nbusiness, money laundering, and steal the diamond, which is displayed to wow the \\ncrowd. \\nFrom there, it turns into an everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink comic thriller where the \\nseeming pinball-machine randomness of the story evokes the Pink Panther films and \\nBob Hope and Bing Crosby’s “Road” series more so than a standard heist picture. It \\ndoesn’t add up to much, and it evaporates from the mind as soon as it’s over, but that \\nwas true of the other two movies, which made over $700 million globally despite mostly \\nlukewarm reviews. At a time when nothing but familiar IP films seem to be able to get \\nany traction (“Sinners” notwithstanding), that’s another kind of magic trick.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",

    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
