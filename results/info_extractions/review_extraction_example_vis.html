<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">A filmed record of stage magic doesn’t make a lot of sense</span>, if you think about it. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">An 
illusionist needs a live audience to conjure deep feelings of mystery and wonder</span>, 
because it’s all happening in the room right in front of you, and you can study the 
performers and the stage to try to figure out how they did the tricks—and be delightfully 
mystified when you can’t. In movies (and on TV), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the magic tricks themselves can’t 
actually impress you</span>, because editing and visual effects can do just about anything. 
That means that the only magic trick left is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">staying a step ahead of the plot guessers in 
the audience, whose primary source of pleasure is figuring out where things are going 
before the movie gets there</span>. To its credit, the “Now You See Me” trilogy, about magic 
experts tricking powerful bad guys, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">understands this principle and conveys it with 
humor and a light touch</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">That understanding, plus a strong cast, is the only thing 
preventing the films from turning into jumbled, giant bags of arbitrary plot twists, eager 
to outsmart viewers into nonsense</span>. 
The third entry in the series, “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">stays on the right side of 
that risk</span> as it reintroduces the Four Horsemen, a quartet of conjurers and other 
tricksters, and throws them into a plot to steal the world’s biggest diamond. Jesse 
Eisenberg‘s J. Daniel Atlas, the erstwhile leader of the group, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">is even more confidently 
forceful now</span> (Eisenberg has aged out of wunderkind arrogance, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">his onscreen 
superpower in films like “The Social Network” and Zack Snyder’s DC films, and into 
something more grounded</span>). As in the other movies, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a lot of the fun comes from 
watching his equally egotistical team resist his authority, bicker, and insult each other</span>. 
It’s all overseen by new-to-the-series director Ruben Fleischer (reunited with his 
“Zombieland” stars) and four credited writers. The team tries to balance giving 
audiences something old and something new, while simultaneously laying the track for 
the series to continue with younger characters if the returning players get tired or ask for 
too much money to appear in a fourth installment. 
The aforementioned huge diamond is the property of glamorous international crime 
syndicate boss Veronika Vanderberg (Rosamund Pike), a South African. In this one, the 
ever-morphing quartet is rounded out by Woody Harrelson‘s porkpie-hatted mentalist 
Merritt McKinney; Dave Franco‘s card shark Dave Wilder; and Isla Fisher (who replaced 
Lizzy Caplan in the second movie as the group’s sole female member) as Henley 
Reeves, an escapologist who used to be Danny’s assistant and girlfriend. Morgan 
Freeman makes a brief return appearance as Thaddeus Bradley, the retired ex-magician 
turned debunker, and once the Grandmaster of The Eye, the secret society that has 
(some) authority over the Horsemen. And there are some other surprise appearances 
that we won’t divulge here, even though they’re listed on IMDb. 
The opening sequence seems like an anniversary celebration of the Horsemen’s 
founding, but it turns into a debut for a trio whose illusions serve charity and social 
activism: Justice Smith’s Charlie, Ariana Greenblatt’s June, and Dominic Sessa’s Bosco
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Leroy. After the trio outs a crypto huckster and redistributes his wealth, Danny is so 
impressed that he recruits them to join the Horsemen in a mission to Antwerp, where 
Veronika is cultivating her network of diamond aficionados to maintain her real 
business, money laundering, and steal the diamond, which is displayed to wow the 
crowd. 
From there, it turns into an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink comic thriller</span> where the 
seeming pinball-machine randomness of the story <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">evokes the Pink Panther films and 
Bob Hope and Bing Crosby’s “Road” series</span> more so than a standard heist picture. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It 
doesn’t add up to much</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">it evaporates from the mind as soon as it’s over</span>, but that 
was true of the other two movies, which made over $700 million globally despite <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">mostly 
lukewarm reviews</span>. At a time when nothing but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">familiar IP films seem to be able to get 
any traction</span> (“Sinners” notwithstanding), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">that’s another kind of magic trick</span>.
