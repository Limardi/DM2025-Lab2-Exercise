An \nillusionist needs a live audience to conjure deep feelings of mystery and wonder, \nbecause it’s all happening in the room right in front of you, and you can study the \nperformers and the stage to try to figure out how they did the tricks—and be delightfully \nmystified when you can’t. In movies (and on TV), the magic tricks themselves can’t \nactually impress you, because editing and visual effects can do just about anything. \nThat means that the only magic trick left is staying a step ahead of the plot guessers in \nthe audience, whose primary source of pleasure is figuring out where things are going \nbefore the movie gets there. To its credit, the “Now You See Me” trilogy, about magic \nexperts tricking powerful bad guys, understands this principle and conveys it with \nhumor and a light touch. That understanding, plus a strong cast, is the only thing \npreventing the films from turning into jumbled, giant bags of arbitrary plot twists, eager \nto outsmart viewers into nonsense. \nThe third entry in the series, “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” stays on the right side of \nthat risk as it reintroduces the Four Horsemen, a quartet of conjurers and other \ntricksters, and throws them into a plot to steal the world’s biggest diamond. Jesse \nEisenberg‘s J. Daniel Atlas, the erstwhile leader of the group, is even more confidently \nforceful now (Eisenberg has aged out of wunderkind arrogance, his onscreen \nsuperpower in films like “The Social Network” and Zack Snyder’s DC films, and into \nsomething more grounded). As in the other movies, a lot of the fun comes from \nwatching his equally egotistical team resist his authority, bicker, and insult each other. \nIt’s all overseen by new-to-the-series director Ruben Fleischer (reunited with his \n“Zombieland” stars) and four credited writers. The team tries to balance giving \naudiences something old and something new, while simultaneously laying the track for \nthe series to continue with younger characters if the returning players get tired or ask for \ntoo much money to appear in a fourth installment. \nThe aforementioned huge diamond is the property of glamorous international crime \nsyndicate boss Veronika Vanderberg (Rosamund Pike), a South African. In this one, the \never-morphing quartet is rounded out by Woody Harrelson‘s porkpie-hatted mentalist \nMerritt McKinney; Dave Franco‘s card shark Dave Wilder; and Isla Fisher (who replaced \nLizzy Caplan in the second movie as the group’s sole female member) as Henley \nReeves, an escapologist who used to be Danny’s assistant and girlfriend. Morgan \nFreeman makes a brief return appearance as Thaddeus Bradley, the retired ex-magician \nturned debunker, and once the Grandmaster of The Eye, the secret society that has \n(some) authority over the Horsemen. And there are some other surprise appearances \nthat we won’t divulge here, even though they’re listed on IMDb. \nThe opening sequence seems like an anniversary celebration of the Horsemen’s \nfounding, but it turns into a debut for a trio whose illusions serve charity and social \nactivism: Justice Smith’s Charlie, Ariana Greenblatt’s June, and Dominic Sessa’s Bosco\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nLeroy. After the trio outs a crypto huckster and redistributes his wealth, Danny is so \nimpressed that he recruits them to join the Horsemen in a mission to Antwerp, where \nVeronika is cultivating her network of diamond aficionados to maintain her real \nbusiness, money laundering, and steal the diamond, which is displayed to wow the \ncrowd. \nFrom there, it turns into an everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink comic thriller where the \nseeming pinball-machine randomness of the story evokes the Pink Panther films and \nBob Hope and Bing Crosby’s “Road” series more so than a standard heist picture. It \ndoesn’t add up to much, and it evaporates from the mind as soon as it’s over, but that \nwas true of the other two movies, which made over $700 million globally despite mostly \nlukewarm reviews. At a time when nothing but familiar IP films seem to be able to get \nany traction (“Sinners” notwithstanding), that’s another kind of magic trick.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_e070bbb0"}
