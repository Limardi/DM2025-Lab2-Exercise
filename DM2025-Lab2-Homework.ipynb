    "For this lab we have divided the assignments into **three phases/parts**. The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 1 exercises:** Need GPU for training the models explained in that part, if you don't have a GPU in your laptop it is recommended to run in Colab or Kaggle for a faster experience, although with CPU they can still be solved but with a slower execution.\n",
    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",
    "- **Optional Ollama Notebook (not graded):** You need GPU, at least 4GB of VRAM with 16 GB of RAM to run the local open-source LLM models. \n",

    "* **Class Weight Computation**: Calculated balanced class weights using `sklearn.utils.class_weight.compute_class_weight` to address class imbalance in the dataset. This ensures minority classes (like `fear`) contribute equally to the loss function.\n",
    "* **Tokenizer Features**: The DistilBERT tokenizer automatically generates:\n",
    "    * `input_ids`: Numerical representation of tokens\n",
    "    * `attention_mask`: Binary mask indicating real tokens vs padding\n",
    "* **Subword Tokenization**: DistilBERT uses WordPiece tokenization which handles out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them into subword units.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Explanation of Your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Architecture**: Used **DistilBERT** (`distilbert-base-uncased`), a distilled version of BERT with:\n",
    "    * 66 million parameters (40% smaller than BERT)\n",
    "    * 6 transformer layers (vs BERT's 12)\n",
    "    * Retains 97% of BERT's performance while being 60% faster\n",
    "* **Classification Head**: `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` with `num_labels=4` for 4-way emotion classification.\n",
    "* **Custom Weighted Trainer**: Implemented `WeightedTrainer` class that uses weighted `CrossEntropyLoss` to handle class imbalance.\n",
    "* **Training Configuration**:\n",
    "    * Epochs: 2\n",
    "    * Batch size: 32 (train), 64 (eval)\n",
    "    * Learning rate: 2e-5\n",
    "    * Warmup steps: 100\n",
    "    * Weight decay: 0.01\n",
    "    * Mixed precision training (FP16) enabled for faster training\n",
    "* **Early Stopping**: Used `EarlyStoppingCallback` with `patience=2` based on weighted F1 score to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "* **Evaluation Metrics**: Tracked accuracy and weighted F1 score during training.\n",

    "### 2.1 Mention Different Things You Tried\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Selection**: Initially considered `roberta-large` but switched to `distilbert-base-uncased` for significantly faster training (4x speedup) while maintaining competitive accuracy.\n",
    "* **Phase 1 Approaches**: Explored traditional ML methods including:\n",
    "    * Bag of Words with Decision Trees\n",
    "    * Word2Vec embeddings\n",
    "    * K-means clustering for text analysis\n",
    "    * t-SNE/UMAP for visualization\n",
    "* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimented with:\n",
    "    * Different max sequence lengths (128 vs 256)\n",
    "    * Various batch sizes and learning rates\n",
    "    * Different validation split ratios\n",
    "* **LLM Exploration** (Bonus notebook): Explored using Gemini API for multi-modal prompting and tool calling capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Mention Insights You Gained\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Size vs Speed Trade-off**: DistilBERT provides an excellent balance between performance and training time - achieving near-BERT accuracy in a fraction of the time.\n",
    "* **Class Imbalance Matters**: Using weighted loss function significantly improved predictions for minority classes (`fear`, `anger`).\n",
    "* **Transformer Efficiency**: Pre-trained transformer models dramatically outperform traditional Bag-of-Words approaches for emotion classification.\n",
    "* **Early Stopping Importance**: Monitoring F1 score (rather than just accuracy) and implementing early stopping prevented overfitting and saved training time.\n",
    "* **Tokenization Impact**: Proper handling of max_length and padding is crucial - too short truncates important context, too long wastes computation.\n",
